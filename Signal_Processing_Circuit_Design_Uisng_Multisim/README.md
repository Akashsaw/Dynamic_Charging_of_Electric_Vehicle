>> Notch Filter and Bandpass Circuit is Designed in Multisim, this designed notch filter gives maximum attenuation at 81kHz and bandpass filter is designed with a center frequency of 460 kHz to avoid any signal attenuation at the frequency of interest. If these additional frequencies are not removed, they can cause malfunction of the detection circuit.
