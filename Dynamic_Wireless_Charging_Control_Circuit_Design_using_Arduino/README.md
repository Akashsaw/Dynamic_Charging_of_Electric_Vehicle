>> This Control unit is designed to switch "ON" the Charging circuit as it detects the Electric Vehicle over the Transmitting coil. It is designed for the Input voltage of 5v which is transmitted by the "Coil Detection System". If the Coil is Not detected the Transmitting coil delivers minimal power, reducing power loss and increased safety for pedestrians.
