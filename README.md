This Project is Done under the Guidance of Dr. R.K Saket Sir of IIT BHU and Kumari Sarita Ma'am.

## Abstract

>> Electrified transportation is continuously playing an important role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and also an alternative to raising oil prices. Electrified 
transportation demands that a good type of charging networks line up, during a user friendly environment, to encourage adoption. Wireless electric vehicle charging systems (WEVCS) is a possible alternative technology to charge electric vehicles (EVs) with no plug-in problems. In this project, I will be focusing on the method of Dynamic Wireless Charging of Electric vehicles. Along with that, also discussed the Simulink Implementation of the Wireless Power Transfer circuitry along with the proper practical situations like Coil detection, Efficient Power Transfer, and Foreign Object Detections. All the circuit parameters are designed according to the SAE Standards.
